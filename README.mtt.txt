Business Class 2.5.0 README
====================

Thank you for downloading Business Class - Standalone distribution. 
This distribution includes a built-in Drupal installation profile, 
a state-of-the-art theme and full-layered .psd source file(s), 
so it's ready to run (almost) out the box.

Overview
--------

Specifically, your theme pack consists of the following four 
directories:

    * [html]
      Includes a fully functional html static web site based on 
      the purchased theme.
    * [license]
      Includes the License information and references to 
      third-party licenses.
    * [psd]
      Includes the full-layered psd file(s) this theme is 
      based on.
    * [site]
      Includes a full core Drupal distribution with an installation profile.
      *  [d7] Drupal 7.x distribution
      
You can use the html files to build a static web site or to create 
your own theme for any platform, as long as this is permitted by 
the License. You can dig into the source psd files and modify them 
the way you want and reuse, as long as this is permitted by the 
License. Lastly, you can use our installation profile to setup 
your drupal.

Brief installation guide for a Drupal Site
------------------------------------------

If you are unfamiliar with Drupal installation please take a break 
and read Drupal's INSTALL.txt. The file is located into the [site] folder.

   1. Unzip the Business Class Drupal theme package.
   2. Locate the [site]/[d7] directory and upload its content to your 
      server. This directory includes Drupal core and all of the 
      required modules that are used in the theme. If you wish to 
      install the theme in your root directory (often called the 
      "/public_html/" directory), simply place all the extracted 
      files and folders into this directory. Place all files in a 
      sub-directory, if you want the theme installed in a sub-directory 
      of your website.
   3. (important) Create the MySQL database. Make a note of the complete 
      database name. You will need your database username and password 
      during the first couple of steps of your theme installation.
   4. Once all the files have been uploaded, browse to the website 
      address where you have uploaded the files. Next select 
      Business Class 7.x Installer.
   5. On the next  page you will see a message asking you to copy 
      default.settings.php to settings.php. Locate the /sites/default 
      folder and create there the settings.php file as a copy of 
      default.setting.php which also is located there.
   6. In the next step you will be asked for the Database name, user and password. 
      You can also give some information about your Drupal installation as the 
      site name or title, admin name, admin email address and so on.
   7. Finally, follow the next steps to complete the installation process.
